# BattleshipWebServer
This repository contains a project for CSCI 466 Networks.

We wrote a distributed implementation of the game "Battleship" using python3.
We also defined application-specific HTTP messages to send information from one player's client to the other player's sever.

A detailed outline of the requirements for this lab can be found in the "Assignment_1_Instructions.pdf" document.
A demo of our functional client/server Battleship game can be found at this YouTube link: https://youtu.be/knaKXVUNX4k
