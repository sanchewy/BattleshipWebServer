# BattleshipWebServer
This repository contains a project for CSCI 466 Networks.
We will write a distributed implementation of the Battleship game using python3.
We will also define application-specific HTTP messages to send information from one player's client to the other player's sever.

For a more detailed outline of the requirements for this lab, please see the Assignment_1_Instructions.pdf document (because I don't want to type them here).

--TODO--
Add actual use instructions when we have something that works.
